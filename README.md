# kaggleKernels
these are the kernels  I worked on on the kaggle platform
they all can be found on my kaggle profile also 
https://www.kaggle.com/nadergo/notebooks

the kernel are about 

* [neural networks for hybrid recommender system](https://github.com/NaderJS/kaggleKernels/blob/master/hybrid-anime-recommendations-with-pytorch.ipynb)
* [english to arabic (with transformers)](https://github.com/NaderJS/kaggleKernels/blob/master/english-to-arabic-with-a-pytorch-transformer.ipynb)
* [text classification](https://github.com/NaderJS/kaggleKernels/blob/master/classifying-hate-speech-with-a-pytorch-transformer.ipynb)
* [question answering for the risk factors of covid19](https://github.com/NaderJS/kaggleKernels/blob/master/risk-factors-question-answering-biobert.ipynb)
